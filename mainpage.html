    <p> I remember it like it was yesterday. My mom when I turned 12 got tired of doing my hair, 
                            so she handed me a wide comb and simply said <i>"goodluck!"</i> Suddenly I was left the sole caretaker
                            of a 12 year old 4C afro that didn't understand what "laid down" meant. My hair and I have come a long way 
                            since then. I hope everything I have learned about my hair can help you have a better relationship with yours! 
                            Think of this website as free hair therapy ;) </p>
